# 🛠️ SailPoint Task Framework – Deep Dive  

---

## 🌟 1. What is the Task Framework?  
- The **Task Framework** in IIQ allows you to run **background jobs**.  
- These jobs can **aggregate data, run reports, sync identities, or perform cleanups**.  
- Tasks can be:  
  - Run manually (on demand).  
  - Scheduled (nightly, weekly, etc.).  

👉 Think of it as a **job scheduler + executor** inside IIQ.  

---

## ⚙️ 2. Why Do We Need Tasks?  

- Aggregating accounts from multiple apps.  
- Running certification generation.  
- Refreshing identity cubes.  
- Executing bulk provisioning actions.  
- Generating reports for auditors.  

Without tasks, admins would have to **trigger everything manually** 😵.

## 🔹 3. Task Components  

1. **TaskDefinition** 📜  
   - Defines the task (name, description, parameters).  

2. **TaskExecutor** ⚡  
   - Java class/logic that executes the task.  

3. **TaskSchedule** ⏰  
   - Defines when the task runs (daily, weekly, monthly).  

4. **TaskResult** 📊  
   - Stores execution results (success, failure, logs).

## 🏗️ 4. Common Built-in Tasks  

- **Aggregation Task** 📥 → Pull accounts from connected applications.  
- **Refresh Identity Cubes** 🔄 → Update identity attributes and entitlements.  
- **Certification Generation Task** ✅ → Generate access review campaigns.  
- **Data Export Task** 📂 → Export identity/account data into files.  
- **Policy Scan Task** 🔍 → Check for policy violations (SoD conflicts).  
- **Report Execution Task** 📊 → Run custom or built-in reports.  

---

## 🔄 5. Task Flow  

1. Admin schedules or triggers task.  
2. IIQ loads the **TaskDefinition**.  
3. Executes via **TaskExecutor** (logic in Java/Beanshell).  
4. Stores results in **TaskResult** (viewable in UI).  
5. Sends notification if configured.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 6. Developer’s Role  

As a SailPoint Developer, you’ll:  
- Configure **TaskDefinitions** (XML or UI).  
- Write **custom tasks** in Java/Beanshell if built-ins are not enough.  
- Debug **TaskResults** when failures occur.  
- Optimize tasks (avoid heavy aggregation in peak hours).  

👉 Example: Writing a custom cleanup task to disable stale accounts.

## 🔍 7. Real-World Analogy  

Think of tasks as **factory machines 🏭**:  
- **TaskDefinition = Machine design (blueprint)** 📝  
- **TaskExecutor = Machine operator (runs the job)** ⚡  
- **TaskSchedule = Timer switch (when to run)** ⏰  
- **TaskResult = Finished goods + quality report** 📊  

Without machines (tasks), workers (admins) would have to **handcraft everything manually**.  

---

## ✨ In short:  

- **Task Framework = Job execution engine** in IIQ.  
- Automates **aggregation, reporting, certifications, cleanups**.  
- Developers can extend it with **custom tasks**.  
- Results are stored, auditable, and can be scheduled.
