# 🚀 SailPoint Workflow Mastery Roadmap 🛡️

---

## 1️⃣ Phase 1: Foundation (1–2 Weeks) ✨
**Goal:** Understand workflow basics and structure.

- Learn what a **workflow** is and its role in IIQ 🧩  
- Understand **workflow vs rules** relationship 🔗  
- Explore **UI sections**:  
  - Design → Workflows  
  - Monitor → Workflow Instances 👀  
- Create **simple test workflows**:  
  - Log identity creation: `log.info("Identity created")` 📝  
  - Trigger a simple notification step ✉️  
- Practice **manual execution** of workflows 🖱️  
- Key DB Tables to observe:  
  - `WF_DEFINITION` → workflow templates  
  - `WF_INSTANCE` → workflow runs

---

## 2️⃣ Phase 2: Rule Integration (2–3 Weeks) 🔧
**Goal:** Learn to attach rules to workflow steps.

- Study **all rule types**: Correlation, Provisioning, Task, Notification 📜  
- Practice **referencing rules**


---
# 3️⃣ Phase 3: Event-Driven Workflows (2–3 Weeks) ⚡

**Goal:** Automate workflow execution via system events.

- **Learn trigger rules:**  
  - Detect identity create/update/delete events 🆕✏️❌  
  - Pass `identity` object to triggered rules 💡  
- Connect workflows to **identity events** 🔗  
- Test **connector-driven execution** (AD, Workday, CSV imports) 📂  
- Explore **WorkflowRunner API** in Beanshell rules:  
```java
Workflow wf = context.getObjectByName(Workflow.class, "EmployeeOnboardingWorkflow");
WorkflowRunner.run(wf, inputs, context);
```
- Validate automatic workflow execution in Monitor → Workflow Instances.
---

## 4️⃣ Advanced Features (3–4 Weeks) ✨
**Goal:** Build robust, scalable, and maintainable workflows.

- **Dynamic Inputs/Outputs:** Use workflow parameters flexibly to pass data between steps.  
- **Error Handling:** Always check for nulls, catch exceptions, and log errors (`log.info()`) for debugging.  
- **Branching Logic:** Implement conditional step execution based on identity/account attributes.  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Avoid loops inside provisioning/correlation rules for large datasets.  
  - Optimize queries using `.context.find()` instead of fetching all objects.  
- **Workflow Versioning & Deployment:** Learn best practices for version control of workflows.  
- **DB Execution Tracking:** Study key tables:  
  - `WF_INSTANCE` → workflow run metadata  
  - `WF_STEP_INSTANCE` → per-step execution  
  - `WF_LOG` → step-level logs

---

## 5️⃣ Real-World Automation (Ongoing) 🌐
**Goal:** Master end-to-end workflow automation.

- **End-to-End Workflows:** Build onboarding/offboarding automation:  
  1. Aggregate Accounts  
  2. Correlate Accounts  
  3. Provision Roles & Entitlements  
  4. Send Notifications  
- **Multi-Connector Integration:** AD, Workday, Salesforce, CSV imports.  
- **Event-Driven, Scheduled, API-Triggered Workflows:** Automate everything, don’t rely on manual triggers.  
- **Monitoring & Logs:** Track workflow execution in UI → Monitor → Workflow Instances.  
- **Performance & Maintainability:** Optimize for enterprise-scale deployments.  
- **Documentation:** Clear documentation for rules, steps, and workflow logic helps audits and team collaboration.

---

## 🔑 Key Mastery Tips
- Workflow = orchestrator 🔄 | Rule = logic 💡  
- Always test in **dev environment** before production.  
- Use **logging** extensively inside rules and steps.  
- Monitor **workflow instances** regularly to catch failures early.  
- Document **inputs/outputs** for reusability.  
- Practice **real-world scenarios**: onboarding, offboarding, entitlement updates.

---

## 🏆 Optional Advanced Practices
- Build a **custom reusable rule library** for workflows.  
- Implement **complex branching & approvals** inside workflows.  
- Integrate **SailPoint API calls** for external system automation.  
- Track **workflow performance metrics** & optimize large-scale workflows.
