# üõ°Ô∏è SailPoint Workflows ‚Äì Consolidation üöÄ

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Workflow?
- Sequence of steps orchestrated to automate identity processes.
- Event-driven or scheduled; never contains rule code directly.
- References independent rules for logic execution.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Components
- **Workflow Definition**: Template stored in DB (`WF_DEFINITION`).
- **Workflow Steps**: Actions like aggregate, correlate, provision, notify.
- **Rules**: Independent Beanshell scripts (`Setup ‚Üí Rules`) called by steps.
- **Execution Instance**: Runtime data in `WF_INSTANCE`, `WF_STEP_INSTANCE`, `WF_LOG`.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Pass identity, accounts, or parameters between steps.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow Triggers
| Trigger Type | How It Works | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Manual | Admin clicks Run | Test workflow for new identity |
| Rule-based | Trigger Rule calls `WorkflowRunner.run()` | New identity triggers onboarding |
| Scheduled Task | Runs on schedule | Nightly entitlement reconciliation |
| Event / Connector | Connector detects changes | New AD account triggers aggregation/correlation |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow & Rule Relationship
- Rules = reusable logic  
- Workflow = orchestrator calling rules  
- Steps reference rules via `<RuleRef>`  
- Rules are **not inside workflow**, only referenced.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow Execution Flow
1. Identity created ‚Üí event detected.  
2. Triggered rule runs ‚Üí calls workflow.  
3. Workflow instance created (`WF_INSTANCE`).  
4. Steps executed sequentially: aggregate ‚Üí correlate ‚Üí provision ‚Üí entitlements ‚Üí notifications.  
5. Logs stored (`WF_LOG`, `WF_STEP_INSTANCE`).  
6. User provisioned in target systems (AD, Workday, Salesforce).

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Execution
- **UI:** Monitor ‚Üí Workflows ‚Üí Workflow Instances  
- Track step status: Pending, Running, Completed, Failed  
- Logs via `log.info()` from rules  
- DB Tables: `WF_INSTANCE`, `WF_STEP_INSTANCE`, `WF_LOG`

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Developer Actions
| Component | UI Location | Developer Task |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Trigger Rule | Setup ‚Üí Rules | Write Beanshell logic to call workflow |
| Workflow | Design ‚Üí Workflows | Drag-drop steps, attach rules, configure parameters |
| Step Rules | Setup ‚Üí Rules | Provisioning, correlation, notifications logic |
| Execution | Monitor ‚Üí Workflow Instances | Track logs, verify role/account creation |
| Outcome | Target Systems | Verify accounts, roles, entitlements, notifications |

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Mastery Roadmap
**Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation:** Workflow basics, structure, steps, rule references  
**Phase 2 ‚Äì Rule Integration:** Attach rules to steps, debug logic with logs  
**Phase 3 ‚Äì Event-Driven Workflows:** Trigger rules for automated workflow execution  
**Phase 4 ‚Äì Advanced Features:** Dynamic inputs/outputs, error handling, bulk operations  
**Phase 5 ‚Äì Real-World Automation:** End-to-end workflows, multi-connector integration, optimization, documentation

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**
- Workflows orchestrate steps; rules provide logic.  
- Trigger rules automate workflow execution on identity events.  
- Execution tracked in `WF_INSTANCE`, `WF_STEP_INSTANCE`, `WF_LOG`.  
- Hands-on practice and debugging are essential for mastery.
